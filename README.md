# Visual Aid

# Read Me

# **This project builds a real-time hazard detection system for visually impaired users by combining YOLO object detection with a C++ priority queue (max-heap) to rank obstacles based on distance and speed. Using Pybind11, Python-based vision data is passed into a C++ processing pipeline that assigns danger scores and triggers alerts when risk thresholds are exceeded. The system operates on a standard webcam feed, demonstrating an efficient, low-cost approach to prioritizing environmental hazards and providing a foundation for future portable assistive navigation tools**
